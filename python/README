To install the Python wrapper for Turbo Parser, please follow the instructions
below. You need to have Cython (at least version 0.19) installed. To install
Cython, type

easy_install cython

Then run:

./install_wrapper.sh

This should create a file turbo_parser.so in local subfolder build/<something>
(e.g. build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7). Create a symbolic link to this file in the
python folder:

ln -s build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/turboparser.so turboparser.so

To test, open a Python shell and type:

>>> import nlp_pipeline

(You may need to add the library path first, e.g.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<root folder>/deps/local/lib"

where <root folder> is an absolute path to the folder where TurboParser is
located.)
