2009-11-26 TurboParser 0.1 afm@cs.cmu.edu
  Initial implementation, based on a C++ implementation of MSTParser and
  using the commercial solver ILOG CPLEX.

2012-09-18 TurboParser 2.0 afm@cs.cmu.edu
  Major refactoring:
  * Implementation of TurboTagger, a sequence model for POS tagging.
  * TurboParser now outputs labeled dependencies.
  * Dictionary and distance pruning to achieve fast decoding.
  * Replaced ILOG CPLEX by the free library AD3.
  * Now use free libraries glog and gflags for easy logging and commandline
  flag processing.
